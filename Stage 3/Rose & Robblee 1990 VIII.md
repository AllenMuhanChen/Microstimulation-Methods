# Electrical Stimulation with Pt Eelectrodes. VIII Electrochemically Safe Charge Injection Limits with 0.2 ms Pulses
**Rose and Robblee 1990**

## Overview
Many investigators have quoted electrochemically safe stimulation using Pt electrodes with GSA of 300-300 μC/cm^<sup>-2</sup>, however these were determined for pulses with durations longer than 0.6 ms and are based on the utilization of all **reversable surface reactions** of Pt during a single pulse. However, for shorter pulses, the amount of charge available from these reverse processes is expected to be smaller . 

The authors tested four different electrodes of varying sizes between GSA of 13000μm<sup>-2</sup> to 950000μm<sup>-2</sup> using CV. **They found that while using 0.2ms/phase pulses, the voltage of their electrodes relative to a SCE (saturated calomel) reference electrode stayed within the potential limits of electrolysis when the cathodic-first pulses had a charge density of about 100-150 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> and when the anodic first pulses had a charge density of about 50-100 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup>**

## Important Facts
Theoretical Charge injection limits are based off of the:
>"...sum of charge available from the chemically reversible processes of double-layer charging, H-atom plating and oxidation, and oxidation and reduction reactios of the platinum surface. [(Brummer & Turner 1977)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4122727)"

The charge limits they found in this paper disagree with these theoretical limits potentially because
1. Pulsing begins with the electrode potential at an intermediate value between H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> formation limits, limiting access to reversible processes. One way to overcome this is to impose an anodic bias on the electrode between pulses. For example, biasing at 0.9V verses SCE increased the injection limit to 600 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> with 0.2 ms cathodal pulses [(Kelliher and Rose 1989)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-online-proceedings-library-archive/article/evaluation-of-charge-injection-properties-of-thin-film-redox-materials-for-use-as-neural-stimulation-electrodes/33A7F06630226D85F0C6433E5056757D)
2. Reversable reactions may not be reaching completion during the short 0.2ms pulse. Longer pulses should allow higher charge limits. One particular type of electrode's anodal first charge injection limit increased to 250 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> from 50-100 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> when the pulse duration was increased to 1 ms (Robblee Cogan and Kimball 1988, Citation 11 in Paper).
