# Neural Stimulation and Recording Electrodes
**Stuart F. Cogan (2008)**

## Definitions
1. The charge delivered by a waveform is equal to the time integral of the current. For a constant current pulse, the charge delivered = i<sub>c</sub>&sdot;t<sub>c</sub>, where c refers to the cathodal pulse. 
2. The **cathodal pulse** in a current versus time waveform refers to the negative side, where the direction of electron flow is from the electrode to the tissue. The current is said to be reducing at the stimulation electrode. The **anodal pulse** refers to the positive side, where the electron flow is from the tissue to the electrode. The current is said to be oxidizing at the stimulation electrode. 
    1. 
3. Q<sub>inj</sub> refers to the charge density in the leading phase. 
    * The leading phase tends to be cathodal. 

## Avoiding Damage
For microstimulation, the three most important considerations for avoiding damage are charge balance, charge/phase and charge density. 
### Charge Balance
### Charge/Phase
### Charge Densities

## Types of Damage
### Electrolysis of Water
Conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. This causes subsequent pH changes, gas formation, and electrode dissolution. 
### Oxidation of Organics 
For example, glucose and tyrosine.
### Electrode Degradation 
Common with Pt and Iridium Oxide

## Charge Injection Mechanisms
Charge injection can happen either capacitatively or fardaically. In theory, capacitive charge injection is more favorable as it is less likely to cause damage, however they have lower maximum Q<sub>inj</sub>.
