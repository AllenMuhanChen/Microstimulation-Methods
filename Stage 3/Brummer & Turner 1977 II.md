# Electrical Stimulation with Pt Electrodes: II-Estimation of Maximum Surface Redox (Theoretical Non-Gassing) Limits
**Brummer and Turner 1977**

## Overview
One of the first papers to try to determine the safe limits for Pt electrodes. 
The authors used Potential Transients and Coulometry to determine an oudated threshold of around 300 Î¼C/cm<sup>-2</sup>

## Important Facts
There is a series of reversible reactions that occur before electrolysis.
