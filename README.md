# Project-Stim
This is a syntopical reading project about microstimulation. 

What is syntopical reading? https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/

The Main Question: 
  Given an electrode with a particular geometric surface area (GSA), material, etc., and a particular brain region of interest in the macaque monkey, what stimulation waveform is sufficient to produce a neurological effect without damaging the tissue or electrodes?
