# Project-Stim
This is a syntopical reading project on microstimulation. 

What is syntopical reading? https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/

**The Main Question:** 
  Given an electrode with a particular geometric surface area (GSA), material, etc., and a particular brain region of interest in the macaque monkey, what stimulation waveform is sufficient to produce a neurological effect without damaging the tissue or electrodes?
  
**The Main Goal:**
  To produce a detailed instructable on microstimulating the brain.
