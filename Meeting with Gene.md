# Meeting with Dr. Fridman (11/18/19)

## Questions
1. To Calculate 300 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> per phase, do you just integrate your signal to get the charge injected and then divide by the surface area of the electrode right?
2. **What determines the number of 300 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup>? Is this a hard rule? Are there ways to push past this threshold safely** 
3. Is the number 300 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup> with a bias?
4. Is it necessary to do potentiometer experiments to verify the waveform I use isn't doing electrochemistry? 
5. **Is there a rule of thumb excitation threshold? I found threhsolds of ~1 nC per phase.**
6. Everything is reported in phase, but what's effect of the length of the phase? On the excitation thresholds? On the damage thresholds? 
7. What damage does bubbling hydrogen/oxygen gas do to the brain? 


## My electrodes:
1. 32-64 Channels 
2. 176 μm<sup>2</sup> GSA Pt-Ir contacts
3. with a charge density of 283 μC/cm<sup>-2</sup>, I get Charge/phase of 0.5 nC. 
4. 50μm within stereotrode or tetrode group.
