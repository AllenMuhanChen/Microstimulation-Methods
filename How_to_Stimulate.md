# How to Stimulate 
This file is the synthesis of what is learned from this reading project. The goal is to have an instructable on exactly what you need to do in order to successfully microstimulate without damaging the brain or electrode. 

To microstimulate safely, you need to create a stimulation waveform (current over time) with:
1. Total leading phase charge injected (q) greater than the threshold of ~1 nC ph<sup>-1</sup> 
2. (q) less than the damage threshold of ~4 nC ph([McCreery et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595500001908); [McCreery et al., 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378595594902585); [McCreery et al., 2006](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1608523))
3. Current Density in the leading phase (Q<sub>inj</sub>) less than 50-150 Î¼C cm<sup>-2</sup>
